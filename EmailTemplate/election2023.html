                            <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333;">Dated: 14.09.2024</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333;">Hon’ble Justice J.R. Midha (Retd), Administrators,<br>Indian Orthopaedic Association, New Delhi.</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333;"><strong>Subject: Elections 2023</strong></p>
                            <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333;">
                                Hon’ble Sir, <br>
                                The IOA shall remain indebted for the work you have done in purification of the voter’s list and bringing into light the illegal voting done in 2020, 2021 and 2022 IOA Elections. Your Third Report and the works spoken therein speak volumes about your integrity and autonomy you have shown with your exemplary words, giving a damn to any of the Members accusing you in discharging your true duty, may I take the liberty to reproduce the same as under:
                            </p>
                            <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333;">
                                “The undersigned of the opinion that there is no impediment in the disclosure of the Voted Member List of 2020, 2021 and 2022 to the Members of IOA. <span class="highlight">The publication of the Voted Member List of 2020, 2021 and 2022 will enable the Members to identify the fake voting done in 2020, 2021 and 2022 elections.</span> The undersigned has therefore published 2020, 2021 and 2022 Voted Member List on the website of IOA on 13th February, 2024.”
                            </p>
                            <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333;">
                                It was on account of your strong stand and the fearless report prepared and submitted, the Hon’ble High Court vide order dated 4th September, 2024 put a quietus to any doubt or misconception in openly declaring the status of the 2020 elections saying that the elections were vitiated and stand nullified and the EC will not be restituted, by amplifying the order dated 20th October, 2023.
                            </p>
                            <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333;">As it is not unknown that there were three beneficiaries of the 2020 elections, namely:</p>
                            <ul style="font-size: 14px; color: #333;">
                                <li>Dr Atul Srivastava for Vice Presidents</li>
                                <li>Dr Navin Thakkar for Hony Secretary</li>
                                <li>IOACON Lucknow through Dr Jamal Ashraf</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333;">
                                Who have tried their level best to justify that IOA Election 2020 was not vitiated and no rigging was done, knowing fully well that dead persons’ names were included in the voter list, which list was prepared by none other than Dr. Atul Srivastava, the then Secretary (Tenure 2018-2020), in league with the other beneficiary Dr. Navin Thakkar and Dr. Jamal Ashraf. Dr. Navin Thakkar, being well aware of the fact that Dr. A.K. Gupta, an eminent member of IOA having expired in 2007, yet his name was included in 2020 voter’s list and in subsequent lists, and despite the said fact was brought into notice way back in January, 2023 by Dr. Dhawan through his application, these persons defended the results of IOA Election 2020, claiming no rigging was done. Though it’s a matter of shame, that such an action was carried out and the morals of members were compromised at all levels, and to defend these persons, Dr. Ramesh Sen, the then Vice-President and Election Officer, misusing his position and funds of IOA came as a shield to the said illegal beneficiary, burdening IOA with litigation cost of Rs. 60 lakhs and above by engaging Senior Counsels and Counsels, just to cover their misdeeds.
                            </p>
                            <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333;">
                                Sir, It was due to HMJ Sachin Datta and your support and hard work, the truth prevailed and IOA could save its face.
                            </p>
                            <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333;">
                                It is in this background, I invite your attention to per the Code of Conduct in IOA Election 2020, which provides as under:
                            </p>
                            <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333;">
                                In case any contestant or his representative or assignee is found/proven to have used <span class="highlight">unfair means</span> (including approaching candidates with laptops or to coerce them in any other way, ask them to vote for any particular candidate openly, or, infringing on anyone’s privacy, attempting to cast illegitimate vote, usurp identity of any other voter to cast vote on his behalf <span class="highlight">or indulge in manipulation of any kind</span>, his candidature will be cancelled and he will be debarred from contesting for any post in IOA for the next 5 years and additional strict disciplinary action will be taken against him.
                            </p>
                            <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333;">
                                Now that deck is clear and the fact that an illegitimate vote of Late Dr A.K. Gupta was cast in the elections, resulting into declaration of Election into nullity, coupled with the fact that as per your report dated 13.02.2024, none of the previous Office bearers were assigned any work, as they were debarred in terms of the order dated 20.10.2024, your report records as under:
                            </p>
                            <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333;">
                                “After completion of IOACON-2023, <span> the undersigned has not permitted any office bearer to discharge any official function, except that Dr. Sandeep Kumar, Treasurer and Dr. Pardeep Bageja, Joint Secretary are permitted to sign the cheques of IOA, which is necessary and should be permitted to continue. Except the said office bearers having limited function, <span class="highlight">the undersigned is not assigning any official function to the office bearers of IOA.”</span>
                            </p>
                            <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333;">
                                It is in these circumstances; it is required that you as an Administrator must debar all the beneficiaries from contesting any post for the next 5 years from the day of the judgement, as this will be another positive step in cleaning IOA, for which you were appointed for. Not only the beneficiaries, but every person who came in aid and support of these illegally elected Office bearers must be sent a strong message, so that no one should try and mess with the functioning of the IOA at their whims and fancy.
                            </p>
                            <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333;">
                                I hope that you will take the necessary action in light of the Code of Conduct 2020 of IOA for contesting elections.
                            </p>
                            <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #333;">Thanking you in anticipation,</p>
